Random scripts I use for managing my life on my linux laptop.

bat-status.sh - helps me do long-term performance testing of my battery

clearcomments.sh - replacement for cat that removes comments and blank lines from the file.

encode.sh - my mencoder / ffmpeg scriptlets, mostly for reminding me what I do.

fdate.pl - future date printer.  What date is x days from today?

player.sh - vmware player call to ESX server, for easy launch of ESX guests.

ripdvd.sh - rip a DVD to an ISO

svn-update.sh - my array-based svn/git updater, to keep all my repositories synced locally.

wwan-control.sh - radio controls, must be run via sudo
